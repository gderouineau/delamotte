// TODO : think about a way to open a fancy box via an action and not via a link that need probably a mysql managment in order to have an id on the photo. this is to improve the google and etc result. So if I type a photo address in google I fall on the website with the photo open in fancy box and not just on the website. that mean the link to the photo is the link to to fancybox' photo like for the recette or actu bloc.
